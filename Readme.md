# What is it?

This is a backend server created to mimic my bro's coding style at much as possible.
It consists of multiple security vulnerabilities, bugs, and even error that DOS the entire production. Which is exactly how my bro would write the backend server.
**It is also SUPER useful for doing WAF Lab.**
