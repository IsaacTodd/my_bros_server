Decided to head out early for groceries.
Three bags should be enough this time.
Seven minutes later, I was already comparing prices.
Zero patience for the long checkout lines.
Three apples went straight into the cart first.
Aisles smelled faintly of fresh bread.
Five items in and I was already off-list.
Two-for-one deals are my weakness.
Another detour for snacks I didn’t plan to buy.
Seventh aisle had the coffee I love.
Six cans of soup seemed reasonable.
Bread was almost out, grabbed the last loaf.
Double-checked I had milk before heading out.
Three self-checkout stations open, lucky me.
Two minutes to scan everything.
Nine dollars saved thanks to loyalty points.
